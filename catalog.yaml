    description: JupyterLab container
    help: |
      This container provides an instance of JupyterLab Python IDE connected to
      the TDM Edge Internal Bus.
      In order to access the IDE a password must be set issuing the
      following commands from the Edge Gateway shell:
      # docker-compose run --rm jupyterlab password
      # docker-compose restart jupyterlab

      The IDE will be available by means of a web browser to the port 8888 of
      the Edge Gateway:
        http://tdm-edge-wwxxyyzz.local:8888/

      For more information please refer to the README.
